# Summary
<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->
`PlanetMapper` is an open source Python package which is used visualise, navigate and map astronomical observations of Solar System objects like planets and moons. Astronomers can use `PlanetMapper` to fit and navigate observations,

# Statement of need
<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->
In order to accurately interpret astronomical observations of objects in the solar system, it is crucial to understand the exact geometry of the observation. Some of the first questions in analysing a new dataset is working out exactly what you are looking at, for example:

- How is the planet oriented in the image? 
- What are the latitude and longitude coordinates for each pixel? 
- How is the planet's surface illuminated?
- Are points of light in the background sky moons of the target planet, or background stars?
- What is the line-of-sight velocity of the target's surface, and what is the associated doppler correction?

Without answering these kinds of questions, it is often impossible to accurately interpret the data. However, calculating the appearance of a target body is a complex problem, as it requires accurate knowledge of both the target and observers position and orientation in space at specific times. To add to the complexity, non-trivial effects, such as the light travel time from the target to the observer and stellar aberration must also be accounted for.

The NAIF SPICE Toolkit [@Acton2018] was developed by NASA to provide a standardised set of 'SPICE kernels', datasets containing the positions of solar system objects, and a set of tools to interface with these kernels. This toolkit provides low level functions which can be combined to solve the problem of calculating the appearance of a target body. `PlanetMapper` is designed to significantly simplify the use of SPICE for astronomers, effectively providing a high level interface to the toolkit. For example, the conversion between right ascension/declination coordinates (in the sky of the observer) to latitude/longitude coordinates (on the target body) requires calling ~10 SPICE functions, but can be done in a single function call with `PlanetMapper`. `PlanetMapper` makes use of the `SpiceyPy` package [@Annex2020] which provides a Python interface to the low level SPICE toolkit functions.  

Astronomers can use `PlanetMapper` to calculate the geometry of an astronomical observation, and generate a series of 'backplanes' which contain the coordinates (latitude/longitude, illumination angles, ring plane coordinates, velocities etc.) for each pixel in the observation. These backplanes can be saved to FITS data files for future use, or used directly in Python code. `PlanetMapper` contains functions to project observed data to a map (\autoref{fig:jupiter-mapped}), and to export FITS files containing this mapped data.

Publication quality figures can be created with `PlanetMapper` and the `matplotlib` package [@Hunter2007] - for example, \autoref{fig:wireframe} shows a 'wireframe' plot of Saturn, visualising the appearance of Saturn. These plots can be used to help visualise and plan observing campaigns, and to help interpret observations by providing geometric context for the data.

`PlanetMapper` also includes a graphical user interface (GUI), as shown in \autoref{fig:gui}, which allows users to interactively fit, navigate and save observations with no coding required. This GUI can also be invoked from within Python code, allowing users to easily fit observations within their own data reduction and processing workflow.

`PlanetMapper` is tested with both unit and integration tests which run automatically using GitHub's continuous integration service. The package is well documented, with all public methods and functions containing detailed docstrings, and documentation automatically built at [planetmapper.readthedocs.io](https://planetmapper.readthedocs.io). `PlanetMapper` is distributed on PyPi and the code is licensed under the MIT license.
